# creating a tuple using()
#t = (1,2,4,5)

#t1 = () ---> empty tuple                     
#t1 = (1) --> wrong way to declare a touple with single element
t1 = (1,) # this is the right way to print a single element tuple

#print the elements of a tuple
print(t1)

# tuple cannot support value assignment
#t[0] = 3


# tuple has two type 
t = (1,2,3,4,5,6,1,3,5,)

print(t.count(1))# count is use for how many time a number come
print(t.index(5))# index is use to find value position
